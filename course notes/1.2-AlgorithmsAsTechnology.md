## Efficiency

Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in their efficiency. These differences can be much more significant than differences due to hardware and software.

## Algorithms and other technologies

Total system performance depends on choosing efficient algorithms as much as on choosing fast hardware.

Algorithms are at the core of most technologies used in contemporary computers.
