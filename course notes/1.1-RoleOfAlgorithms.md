## Algorithms
### An Algorithm:
 is a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.
 
 we can view it as tool for solving well-specified **computational problems**.

-> **an instance of a problem** consists of the input needed to compute a solution to the problem.

-> An algorithm is said to be **correct** if, for every input instance, it **halts** with the **correct output**.

## Data Structures
a **Data structure** is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.

## Technique
the technique which used to generate an algoritm is more important than the algoritm itself.

## Hard Problems
**NP-complete** problems are problems that don't have an efficient algorithm to solve it.

## Parallelism
taking advantage of the muliticore processores and making  **multithreaded algorithms**,

which devide the procedure in parts proccesed parallel making it more efficient.
