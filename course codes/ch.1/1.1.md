# 1.1

**1.1- 1:**

Sorting a list of names in alphabetic order.

**1.1- 2:**

space efficiency. 

**1.1- 3:**

the array is a linear data structure, it is good in storing data of the same type which i know the maximum number of it's elements, it takes a lot of space that may not used, if it is full i can't put elements on it, (technically i can but i can't operate on them).

**1.1- 4:**

they are similar in searching of a shortest bath between nodes, the different is that the shortest path doesn't consider all nodes(it's ok if i don't go throw all nodes), but traveling salesman problem demand to go throw all nodes. 

**1.1- 5:**

choosing the best order of places to go throw all of them which gives us the shortest path is a real world example of a problem that doesn't have the best solution just approximated, checking if the factors of numbers are correct is the opposite.
